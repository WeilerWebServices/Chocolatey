## Testing in Linqpad

The .linq file in this folder can be used for validating a URL using Linqpad.  It uses the same code that is used within the package-validator, just in a form that can be directly executed, rather than having to run package-validator directly.

This file should be kept up to date whenever any changes are made to the Utility.cs file in the main code base.
