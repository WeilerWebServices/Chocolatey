# Chocolatey Package Validator

Validates the contents of a package against the package review process parts that can be validated by a machine. See https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/Moderation for more details.

The validator is a service that checks the quality of a package based on requirements, guidelines and suggestions for creating packages for Chocolateyâ€™s community feed. We like to think of the validator as unit testing. It is validating that everything is as it should be and meets the minimum requirements for a package on the community feed.

What does the validator check? See https://github.com/chocolatey/package-validator/wiki

### Compiling / Building Source

There is a `build.bat`/`build.sh` file that creates a necessary generated file named `SolutionVersion.cs`. It must be run at least once before Visual Studio will build.

#### Windows

Prerequisites:

 * .NET Framework 4.5+
 * Visual Studio is helpful for working on source.
 * ReSharper is immensely helpful (and there is a `.sln.DotSettings` file to help with code conventions).

Build Process:

 * Run `build.bat`.

Running the build on Windows should produce an artifact that is tested and ready to be used.


## Setup

You need the following installed on a machine that you will use the validator with:

* .NET Framework 4.5.
* Install the service and let it run.
