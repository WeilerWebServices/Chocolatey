Title: Use Delayed Search
Description: Enables live search, which returns results after a short delay without clicking the search button.
---

By default, when viewing the `This PC` source in Chocolatey GUI, anything that you type into the search box at the top
of the screen will, after a short delay, filter the list of packages to what you have typed in.  Some people prefer that
the search isn't executed until they are finished typing, and actually press the enter key on the keyboard.  Enabling
this feature toggles it so that pressing the entry key is a requirement for the search to be performed.
