In an effort to increase both the flexibility and stability of Chocolatey.org, we will be upgrading part of our infrastructure. This upgrade requires the website and other services be unavailable for a period of time.

On Saturday 26 October 2019 the following services will be unavailable between 3:00 and 9:00 UTC:

* Chocolatey.org Website;
* Community Package Repository;
* Licensed Package Repository;
* Package Validator;
* Package Verifier;
* Package Scanner;
* Package Cacher;
* Manage Chocolatey Packages through Boxstarter;

For all updates, and to check on progress, please use the [Chocolatey.org status page](https://status.chocolatey.org).

In an attempt to mitigate the effect these changes will have, a time was chosen when use of the website and services is minimal. However, we appreciate that some will still be affected and we apologise for the inconvenience caused.
