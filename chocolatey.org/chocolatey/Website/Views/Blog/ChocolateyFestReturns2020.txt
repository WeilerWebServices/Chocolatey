Last year we had a very successful [Chocolatey Fest (aka WinOps SFO)](https://chocolateyfest.com). [Chocolatey Fest 2018](https://chocolateyfest.com) was an amazing event and we want to put on more WinOps-focused conferences, including making Chocolatey Fest a multi-day conference. 

During planning for 2019, we decided to make this a year of strong focus in delivering value to our products and customers, which means that Chocolatey Fest will be back in 2020.
