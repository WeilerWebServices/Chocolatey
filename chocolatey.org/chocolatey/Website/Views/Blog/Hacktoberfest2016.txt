Recently we [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ferventcoder/status/782621022176419840) about participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

### What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a celebration of open source by contributing code. Folks interested in contributing must submit 4 pull requests in the month of October to any [participating issues](https://github.com/search?l=&q=state%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest&ref=advsearch&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93). You must [first sign up](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/sign_up/register) (register with GitHub) to participate. You can do that at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/sign_up/register. 

Best of all, when you submit those 4 pull requests, you qualify for a free T-Shirt from Digital Ocean.

### Chocolatey is participating

Yes, Chocolatey is participating in #Hacktoberfest. All available issues for contributing towards a free t-shirt are [labeled with Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+label:Hacktoberfest). In the issues list you will find the following technologies:

- C#
- PowerShell
- Documentation

So while you may not be familiar with C#, you may be familiar with PowerShell. If you are not familiar with either but you know Chocolatey inside and out, we always have a need for better documentation. Suggest some more things that you want to work on. We might even label them with Hacktoberfest!

If you participate in Hacktoberfest and you contribute to Chocolatey, you may be eligible to win a second T-Shirt.
