### Template - Chocolatey Fest Manager Approval Letter

Subject line: Please send me to Chocolatey Fest this October

Dear [Boss],

As our team has discovered, automation and other DevOps practices aren’t just for Linux shops; it’s increasingly important for Windows teams too. We’ve already seen some success with [name a recent automation project/initiative], and now we need to turn our attention to [name an upcoming initiative/goal].

Chocolatey Fest, a Windows automation conference in San Francisco on 8 October, can help provide the education and best practices we need to reach that goal. The conference brings together WinOps experts from Facebook, Red Hat and Yelp — companies that are leading the way when it comes to Windows automation — and highlights how their teams have use Chocolatey and related technologies to increase time to value, reduce errors, and improve security.

A ticket to Chocolatey Fest includes:
* A full day of sessions on Windows automation, infrastructure as code, testing, security, and more.
* Conversations centered around tools we already use (and some we’re considering), like Chocolatey, Vagrant, Docker, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Azure, AWS and others.
* An evening Hackathon with workshops centered around Docker on Windows, and best practices for deploying Chocolatey.
* Networking with other sysadmins, architects and developers who are tackling some of the same challenges that we are.

The conference ticket costs just $250, and the Hackathon is free. With travel and accommodations totaling [fill in cost], the all-in cost would be [total]. With everything I would learn, that would have a value to the company above and beyond because I could do [fill in some automation needs], that would save the company [savings] over the next year!

I hope you’ll agree that Chocolatey Fest is a worthwhile investment for our company and that you’ll approve my attendance at this year’s event.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
