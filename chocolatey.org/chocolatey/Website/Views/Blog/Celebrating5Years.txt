Chocolatey turned [5 years old recently](https://twitter.com/ferventcoder/status/712410862611341312)! I committed the first lines of Chocolatey code on [March 22, 2011](https://github.com/ferventcoder/nugetpackages/commit/d16ed7ac675395b3bb8ecee90fb13efb03d4b619). At that time I never imagined that Chocolatey would grow into a flourishing community and a tool that is widely used by individuals and organizations to help automate the wild world of Windows software. It’s come a long way since I first showed off early versions of Chocolatey to some friends for feedback. Over the last 2 years things have really taken off!

The number of downloads has really increased year over year!

**Note:** While not a completely accurate representation of usage and popularity, the number of downloads gives a pretty good context. Going up by 7 million in 2014 and then by almost 30 million downloads in one year really shows a trend!

**Note:** The Chocolatey package has about 1,000 downloads per hour. I shut off the statistics for the install script back in October 2015 due to the extreme load on the site, so the number of Chocolatey package downloads is missing some of the statistics.

### History

Let’s take a little stroll through some of the interesting parts of Chocolatey’s history. The history of Chocolatey really starts when I joined the Nubular (Nu) team in summer 2010.

- July 2010 – [Nu (Package Management for .NET)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvxAa4XURss) is reintroduced and quickly takes off in popularity (I also [wrote](http://ferventcoder.com/archive/2010/07/15/gems---package-management-for-.net.aspx) [several](http://ferventcoder.com/archive/2010/07/16/how-to---gems-and-.net.aspx) [posts](http://ferventcoder.com/archive/2010/07/17/how-to-ndash-gems-and-.net-ndash-dependencies-references.aspx) [about](http://ferventcoder.com/archive/2010/07/19/gems-for-.net-ndash-community-response.aspx) [it](http://ferventcoder.com/archive/2010/07/26/the-future-of-.net-open-source-software-delivery.aspx)).
- October 6, 2010 – [NuGet is introduced](http://ferventcoder.com/archive/2010/10/06/the-evolution-of-package-management-for-.net.aspx). The Nu team had joined up with Microsoft in late August to work on NuPack (as it was called then).
- February 2011 – Joke with other folks on the NuGet team at MVP summit that if we ever introduced a machine package manager, we’d call it Chocolatey NuGet because it wouldn’t be vanilla NuGet packages.
- March 21, 2011 – First lines of Chocolatey [are committed](https://github.com/ferventcoder/nugetpackages/commit/d16ed7ac675395b3bb8ecee90fb13efb03d4b619). The PowerShell version of Chocolatey represents the first public known use of PowerShell as an application and not just scripts and modules.
- March 23, 2011 – First release of Chocolatey is [0.6.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/chocolatey/0.6.0). I hope you were not using it that early. ;)

- April 26, 2011 – I [put up a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-hWOUL8roU) showing Chocolatey installing 11 pieces of software. Pardon the music, it was swapped out from my original track.
- September 2011 – Community Repository ([https://chocolatey.org](https://chocolatey.org/)) introduced.
- September 7, 2011 – [Christiaan Baes](https://twitter.com/chrissie1) writes a [post about a side project](https://web.archive.org/web/20110926191629/http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/DesktopDev/MSTech/chocolatey-gui) that is known as [Chocolatey GUI](https://github.com/chocolatey/ChocolateyGUI#features).

- April 23, 2012 – After bouncing ideas off of [Keith Dahlby](https://twitter.com/dahlbyk) and [Aaron Lerch](https://twitter.com/aaronlerch), I figure out how to do [mocking for PowerShell testing](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/3533d00a835c11aaba9aa3f34ff9d052496ff696#diff-48c72ff2102462265651d53d3d4e374f) (which Matt Wrock later puts into [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) proper).

This doesn’t represent everything that has happened. I tried to list out and attribute everything I could find and remember. There have been so many amazing package maintainers over the years, there are too many of you to possibly list. You know who you are. You have made the community what it is today and have been instrumental in shaping enhancements in Chocolatey.

### Looking to the Future

The community has been amazing in helping Chocolatey grow and showing that there is a need that it fills. Package maintainers have put in countless and sometimes thankless hours to ensure community growth and consumers have really found the framework useful! Thank you so much! The next version of Chocolatey is coming and it is [going to be amazing](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Here’s to the next 5 years, may we change the world of Windows forever!
