### File Naming Structure
Each Type of file (Customer Success Story, Video, Case Study, or Feature) has a corresponding number in front of the file to easily identify and keep an organized structure. The second number listed on a file simply numbers each file within their type. 

* Customer Success Story - 01
* Case Study - 02
* Video - 03
* Feature - 04

For example: File name of "01-02-Example" would mean that it is a Customer Success Story and the 2nd file. The "01-02" part of the file name corresponds to the image that is used. In this example, the image associated with this file would be located in "images/videos/01-02.jpg".
