"You can not inspect quality into a product" - Harold F. Dodge
This is as true in running infrastructure as it was on the manufacturing line. By the time we are manually verifying the state of our infrastructure, we are at the most costly and impactful time to deal with problems. Tools like Test-Kitchen and Pester, a testing framework for PowerShell, provide us a way to validate that our infrastructure management tools are getting our environments configured the way we need them, before we roll into production! Let's dig in and see how Test-Kitchen and Pester can help us build quality into our Chocolatey packages, our DSC resources, and our DSC configurations.
