Summary: Dan Sedlacek speaks on Chocolatey at Facebook
---
Facebook is a growing company that already operates at a large scale. For a *nix-centric company what place does Windows have? The answer is: a lot! Over the last 3 years I have been at ground zero for a couple of Facebook's internal teams during their transformation to a DevOps oriented culture as it relates to Windows.

During this talk I will convey a sense of Facebook's approach to building infrastructure at scale, how it differed from my traditional training as a Windows system administrator, where we're at now, and where we'd like to see ourselves go in the future!
