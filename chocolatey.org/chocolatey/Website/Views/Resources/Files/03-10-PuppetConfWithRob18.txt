Traditional approaches to software management on Windows can be manual or inefficient. Chocolatey was designed as a common sense, flexible approach to managing software on Windows, both internal and 3rd party. Chocolatey is a single, unified interface designed to easily work with all aspects of managing Windows software using a packaging framework that understands both versioning and dependency requirements. Chocolatey packages encapsulate everything required to manage a particular piece of software into one deployment artifact by wrapping installers, executables, zips, and scripts into a compiled package file. Configuration management alone without a great package manager will only get you so far. Putting package management with configuration management (Puppet) makes an awesome story for Windows automation!
