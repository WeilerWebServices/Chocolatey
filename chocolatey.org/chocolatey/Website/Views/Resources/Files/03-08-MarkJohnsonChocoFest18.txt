Summary: Mark Johnson, Solutions Architect, takes us on a journey through the lifetime of a Chocolatey package across Windows servers in the enterprise.
---
In this session, we will take a journey through the lifetime of a Chocolatey package across Windows servers in the enterprise. Some of the questions we will answer: 
* How can we publish a Chocolatey package and have it automatically deployed across different environments using Otter and PowerShell DSC?   
* How can we use Git to promote Chocolatey package configuration changes to different environments?   
* How can Otter detect Chocolatey package version drift and automatically remediate it? 
* How can we use Otter to take inventory of all installed Chocolatey packages?
