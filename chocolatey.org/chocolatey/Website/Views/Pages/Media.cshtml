                    The Chocolatey official logo can be presented on any colored background,
                    however it is preferred to be used on one of the official Chocolatey Background Colors. Do not rotate the Chocolatey logo to any degree.

                <h2 id="logo-clear-space" class="mt-5">Clear Space</h2>
