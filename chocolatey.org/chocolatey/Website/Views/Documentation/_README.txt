Contributing to the documentation? Read this first.

Every file except _ViewStart.cshtml and _Layout.cshtml come from https://github.com/chocolatey/choco-wiki. Please file pull requests to fix documentation there. Some files (Commands*.cshtml/Helpers*.cshtml) come from even further up the chain, and those files will direct you to the approximate location where they come from.
