## Usage

Chocolatey Central Management (CCM) works in conjunction with [Chocolatey Agent](https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-agent-service) to bring full details of all Chocolatey controlled machines in your environment into one location, which is then accessible by the CCM Website.  Chocolatey Agent will regularly report information about what is installed on each machine, and whether any of that software is outdated, based on packages in available sources.

## Roadmap

Chocolatey Central Management will allow:

* Centralized Software Management for your entire organization.
* ~~Centralized reporting of software.~~ Completed May 2019
* ~~Know immediately what software is out of date and on what machines.~~ Completed May 2019
* ~~Know within seconds the entire estate of software and what versions are installed.~~ Completed May 2019
  * ~~Including zips and archives* that do not show up in Programs and Features~~ Completed May 2019
  * ~~Including internal software* that does not show up in Programs and Features~~ Completed May 2019
* Adhoc reporting for a particular machine or set of machines
* Run arbitrary Chocolatey commands against one or more machines
* ~~See how many machines you are actively managing in your organization~~ Completed May 2019
* More...

\* - When deployed through Chocolatey.

## Requirements

* Chocolatey (`chocolatey` package) v0.10.14+
* Chocolatey for Business (C4B) Edition
* Chocolatey Licensed Extension (`chocolatey.extension` package) v2.0.0+
* Chocolatey Agent (`chocolatey-agent` package) v0.9.0+
* CCM Database (`chocolatey-management-database` package) v0.1.0+
  * This deploys the CCM database schema to the specified SQL Server instance
* CCM Service (`chocolatey-management-service` package) v0.1.0+
  * This installs the CCM Service, which the Chocolatey Agent will communicate with.
* CCM Website (`chocolatey-management-web` package) v0.1.0+
  * This is the CCM front end website that is the main user interface of the application

## Installation Source

All the packages required to install CCM into your environment are located on the `chocolatey.licensed` feed.  This is the same place that you would install [Chocolatey Agent](https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-agent-service) and the [Chocolatey Extension](https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation-licensed) from.

The `chocolatey.licensed` source is automatically added to your Chocolatey instance when you install the Chocolatey Extension, however, as per the recommended installation best practices, this source is typically [disabled in an organisational context](https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation-licensed#installing-upgrading-in-secure-environments-without-internet-access).  As such, it may be necessary to first download the required packages from the licensed source, and place them into your own internal repository.

## Setup

While it is envisioned that CCM will be installed across multiple servers, it is certainly possible to run CCM on a single server.

Currently, the CCM packages do not provision the SQL Server Database Permissions that are required for the CCM components to function.  It is assumed that the necessary permissions have already been provided (see the [FAQ](#how-can-i-add-sql-server-permissions-through-powershell) for one method of doing it).  By default, two users will require read/write permissions to the CCM Database:

* `ChocolateyLocalAdmin` - which, by default, runs the CCM Service
* `IIS APPPOOL\ChocolateyCentralManagement` - which, by default, runs the CCM IIS Application Pool

**NOTE:** If either of these users are changed during the installation of these components, the database permissions will need to be updated to reflect this.

Or, the required username/password for connecting to the CCM database are added as part of the connection string that is passed into the CCM packages during installation.

### Pre-Requisites

In order to install CCM, it is assumed that the following applications/software are installed:

* At least .Net Framework 4.6.1 on all machines
* IIS on the machine where the `chocolatey-management-web` package will be installed
* SQL Server on the machine where the `chocolatey-management-database` package will be installed

IIS can be installed using the following commands:

~~~powershell
choco install IIS-WebServer --source windowsfeatures
choco install IIS-ApplicationInit --source windowsfeatures
~~~

We will not provide specific instruction on installing SQL Server. Any database platform that supports Entity Framework (EF) Core is supported, and as such there are too many scenarios to cover in this document.

For a list of Database products that support EF Core you can view the Microsoft Docs page [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/#current-providers)

### FQDN Usage

When installing the CCM Service, the default is to use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the machine that it is being installed on.  As a result, there is an expectation that the certificate (either the self signed certificate that is created during installation, or the existing certificate which is configured with the [CertifcateThumbprint](#package-parameters-1) parameter) that is used to secure the transport layer of this service, also uses the same FQDN.

If this is not the case, it will be necessary to provide the information to the package about the actual name for the machine that is being used.  When using a self signed certificate, this can be specified using the `CertifcateDnsName`, and when using an existing certificate, no additional parameters are required.  In both cases, it will be necessary to also set the `centralManagementServiceUrl` [configuration parameter](#centralmanagementserviceurl).  This can be done using the following command:

~~~powershell
choco config set CentralManagementServiceUrl https://<accessible_name_of_machine>:24020/ChocolateyManagementService
~~~

### Install CCM Components

The CCM Components should be installed in the following order:

1. [chocolatey-management-database](#installing-chocolatey-management-database)
1. [chocolatey-management-service](#installing-chocolatey-management-service)
1. [chocolatey-management-web](#installing-chocolatey-management-web)

#### Installing chocolatey-management-database

**NOTE:** It is likely that additional package parameters are required which are specific to your environment.  Please carefully review the available [package parameters](#package-parameters) before proceeding.

In order to successfully install the chocolatey-management-database package onto a machine (using all default values), the following steps are required:

~~~powershell
choco upgrade chocolatey --version 0.10.15
choco upgrade chocolatey.extension --version 2.0.2
choco upgrade chocolatey-agent --version 0.9.1
choco upgrade chocolatey-management-database --version 0.1.0
~~~

##### Package Parameters

This package creates the CCM Database with the following defaults:

* Database Connection String:   **Server=&lt;LOCAL COMPUTER FQDN NAME&gt;; Database=ChocolateyManagement; Trusted_Connection=True;**

You can override the package defaults using the following parameters:

* `/ConnectionString`
  * The SQL Server database connection string to be used to connect to the CCM database.
  * **NOTE:** Default Value: **Server=&lt;LOCAL COMPUTER FQDN NAME&gt;; Database=ChocolateyManagement; Trusted_Connection=True;**
* `/Database`
  * Name of the SQL Server database to use. Note that if you do not also pass `/ConnectionString`, it will be generated using this parameter value and `/SqlServerInstance` (using defaults for missing parameters);
  * **NOTE:** Default Value: **ChocolateyManagement**
* `/SqlServerInstance`
  * Instance name of the SQL Server database to connect to. Note that if you do not also pass `/ConnectionString`, it will be generated using this parameter value and `/Database` (using defaults for missing parameters);
  * **NOTE:** Default Value: **&lt;LOCAL COMPUTER FQDN NAME&gt;**

##### Example

Let's assume that you want to install the CCM Database onto a machine that will access a SQL Server instance called `SQLSERVERCCM`, on a domain machine called `MACHINE1` which is part of the domain `ccmtest`, using a specific user name (ccmservice) and password combination.  In this scenario, the installation command would look like the following:

~~~powershell
choco upgrade chocolatey-management-database --package-parameters-sensitive="'/ConnectionString='Server=MACHINE1\SQLSERVERCCM;Database=ChocolateyManagement;User ID=ccmtest\ccmservice;Password=Password01;''"
~~~

**NOTE:** This command makes use of `package-parameters-sensitive` to ensure that the sensitive information is not leaked out into log files.

##### Verify Installation

The purpose of the `chocolatey-management-database` package is to create and deploy the schema for the database that is used by the CCM Service and Website.  This can be verified by using something like SQL Server Management Studio to connect to the SQL Server Instance and:

* check that a database (by default named `ChocolateyManagement`) has been created
* that a set of tables have been created within this database

#### Installing chocolatey-management-service

**NOTE:** It is likely that additional package parameters are required which are specific to your environment.  Please carefully review the available [package parameters](#package-parameters-1) before proceeding.

In order to successfully install the chocolatey-management-service package onto a machine (using all default values), the following steps are required:

~~~powershell
choco upgrade chocolatey --version 0.10.15
choco upgrade chocolatey.extension --version 2.0.2
choco upgrade chocolatey-agent --version 0.9.1
choco upgrade chocolatey-management-service --version 0.1.0
~~~

  * Explicit request not to restart the service
  * **NOTE:** Default Value: Not provided
* `/DoNotReinstallService`
  * Explicit request not to reinstall the service
  * **NOTE:** Default Value: Not provided

##### Chocolatey Managed Password

When Chocolatey manages the password for a local administrator, it creates a very complex password:

* It is 32 characters long.
* It uses uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols to meet very stringent complexity requirements.
* The password is different for every machine.
* Due to the way that it is generated, it is completely unguessable.
* No one at Chocolatey Software could even tell you what the password is for a particular machine without local access.

##### Chocolatey Central Management Service Windows Account Considerations

* Windows Account (required, defaults to `ChocolateyLocalAdmin`)
  * The Chocolatey Central Management Service requires ***an*** administrative account, whether that is a domain account or a local account - it just needs to be a local admin (a member of the Administrators group).
  * The Chocolatey Central Management Service doesn't specifically require the `ChocolateyLocalAdmin` account, any Windows account can be used. The `ChocolateyLocalAdmin` is used as the default if one is not specified.
  * Upon use of an account during installation, it will make that account a member of the Administrators account.
  * The account used will also be granted LogonAsService and LogonAsBatch privileges.
* Managed Password (optional, default)
  * When the `ChocolateyLocalAdmin` account is used, it generates a managed password that is different on every machine, 32 characters long, meets complexity requirements, and basically very strong.
  * To determine the managed password, it would take access to the box and someone from Chocolatey Software who has access to the algorithm used to generate the password (more information in the FAQs below).
* Rotating/Updating Passwords
  * If a different account with a rotating password is used, the service will need to be updated with the new credentials and restarted soon after changing that password.
  * The managed password is not currently updated/rotated, but it is something we are looking at how best to implement.


##### Example

Let's assume that you want to install the CCM Service with a specific connection string in order to connect to the CCM Database, as well as configure the CCM Service to use a specific user name and password, as well as alter the Port number that the CCM Service will be hosted on.  The necessary installation command would look like the following:

~~~powershell
choco upgrade chocolatey-management-service --package-parameters-sensitive="'/PortNumber=24021 /Username=ccmtest\ccmservice /Password=Password01 /ConnectionString='Server=MACHINE1\SQLSERVERCCM;Database=ChocolateyManagement;User ID=ccmtest\ccmservice;Password=Password01;''"
~~~

**NOTE:** This command makes use of `package-parameters-sensitive` to ensure that the sensitive information is not leaked out into log files.

##### Verify Installation

The `chocolatey-management-service` is responsible for making a number of changes to your system.  A successful installation of this package can be verified by:

* Open the services snap-in (services.msc) and check for the presence of the `Chocolatey Management Service` which should be in the started state
* Open the Service log file located at `$env:ChocolateyInstall\lib\chocolatey-management-service\tools\service\logs\chocolatey.service.host.log` and verify that there are no recently reported errors

#### Installing chocolatey-management-web

**NOTE:** It is likely that additional package parameters are required which are specific to your environment.  Please carefully review the available [package parameters](#package-parameters-2) before proceeding.

In order to successfully install the chocolatey-management-web package onto a machine (using all default values), the following steps are required:

~~~powershell
choco upgrade aspnetcore-runtimepackagestore --version 2.2.7
choco upgrade dotnetcore-windowshosting --version 2.2.7
choco upgrade chocolatey --version 0.10.15
choco upgrade chocolatey.extension --version 2.0.2
choco upgrade chocolatey-agent --version 0.9.1
choco upgrade chocolatey-management-web --version 0.1.0
~~~

**NOTE:** Once installed, when you access the CCM Website you will be prompted to provide a username and password to access the site.  By default, the username is `ccmadmin` and the password is `123qwe`.  After you input this, you will be prompted to change the password.

##### Package Parameters

This package creates the CCM Website and Application Pool with the following defaults:

* IIS Web Application Pool:                 **ChocolateyCentralManagement**
  * enable32BitAppOnWin64:                **True**
  * managedPipelineMode:                  **Integrated**

  * applicationDefaults.preloadEnabled:   **True**
* SQL Server Instance:                      **&lt;LOCAL COMPUTER FQDN NAME&gt;**
* Connection String:                        **Server=&lt;LOCAL COMPUTER FQDN NAME&gt;; Database=ChocolateyManagement; Trusted_Connection=True;**

You can override the package defaults using the following parameters:

* `/ConnectionString`
  * The SQL Server database connection string to be used to connect to the CCM Database;
  * **NOTE:** Default Value: **Server=&lt;LOCAL COMPUTER FQDN NAME&gt;; Database=ChocolateyManagement; Trusted_Connection=True;**
* `/Database`
  * Name of the SQL Server database to use. Note that if you do not also pass `/ConnectionString`, it will be generated using this parameter value and `/SqlServerInstance` (using defaults for missing parameters);
  * **NOTE:** Default Value: **ChocolateyManagement**
* `/SqlServerInstance`
  * Instance name of the SQL Server database to connect to. Note that if you do not also pass `/ConnectionString`, it will be generated using this parameter value and `/Database` (using defaults for missing parameters);
  * **NOTE:** Default Value: **&lt;LOCAL COMPUTER FQDN NAME&gt;**
* `/Username`
  * The username that the IIS WebApplicationPool will run under. If this is not provided the pool will run under the default account. Note that if you provide this you must also provide either the `/Password` or `/EnterPassword` parameter;
  * **NOTE:** Default Value: **IIS APPPOOL\ChocolateyCentralManagement**
* `/Password`
  * The password for the username (provided via the `/Username` parameter) the IIS WebApplicationPool will run under;
  * **NOTE:** Automatically generated secure password
* `/EnterPassword`
  * This will prompt you to enter the password, during install, for the username (provided via the `/Username` parameter) the IIS WebApplicationPool will run under;
  * **NOTE:** Default Value: Not provided

##### Example

Let's assume that you want to install the CCM Website with a specific connection string in order to connect to the CCM Database, as well as configure the IIS Application Pool to use a specific user name and password.  The
necessary installation command would look like the following:

~~~powershell
choco upgrade chocolatey-management-web --package-parameters-sensitive="'/ConnectionString='Server=MACHINE1\SQLSERVERCCM;Database=ChocolateyManagement;User ID=ccmtest\ccmservice;Password=Password01;' /Username=ccmwebserver\ccmserviceuser /Password=Password01'"
~~~

**NOTE:** This command makes use of `package-parameters-sensitive` to ensure that the sensitive information is not leaked out into log files.

##### Verify Installation

The `chocolatey-management-web` package is responsible for creating and deploying the CCM Website within IIS.  A successful installation of this package can be verified by:

* Opening an internet browser on the machine to the following address `http://localhost` which should result in the login page for CCM being displayed
* It should be possible to login to the site using the default credentials mentioned in the installation steps
* Open the Site log file located at `c:\tools\chocolatey-management-web\App_Data\Logs\Logs.txt` and verify that there are no recently reported errors

##### Additional Installation Steps

Once installed, some one-time configuration steps are required.

###### SMTP Configuration

The CCM Site needs to be able to send email for certain actions.  For example, when a new user is registering with the system, or when sending out forgotten password emails.  Valid SMTP Configuration has to be provided in order for these emails to be sent out.  Follow these steps to configure SMTP for CCM.

1. Open the CCM Site in the browser
1. Login with the `ccmadmin` user
1. In the left hand menu click on `Administration` and then `Settings`
1. Click on the `Email (SMTP)` tab in the `Settings` screen
1. Add the SMTP settings for your environment
1. Click the `Save All` button to save changes
1. Click the `Send Test Email` button and ensure that an email is received correctly

You should received a notification similar to this:

![Test email sent successfully](images/features/ccm/test_email_sent_correctly.png)

###### appsettings.json configuration

NOTE: In future versions of CCM, this configuration will likely be automatically applied during installation, and this step will not be required.

There is a requirement within the CCM site to send emails to end users of the application.  For example, when registering a new user, or resetting a password.  To ensure that these emails contain a properly clickable link a modification needs to be made to the `appsettings.json` file which is located in the `c:\tools\chocolatey-management-web` folder.

Open this file in a text editor, and add the following entry:

~~~json
    "App": {
        "WebSiteRootAddress": "<URL_to_CCM>"
    }
~~~

NOTE: When adding this entry, be sure to include a `,` either before or after the entry, depending on where you add it in the file.  i.e. the end result needs to be a properly formatted JSON document.

where `URL_to_CCM` should be the accessible URL to access the CCM Website.  This will typically be the FQDN of the server that is hosting the CCM Web Site, but it will depend on your environments configuration.

The end result should look something like this:

![Modified appsettings.json file](images/features/ccm/updated_appsettingsjson_file.png)

Once this change has been added, save the file, and then run the following to ensure that the process running the CCM Website is stopped:

~~~powershell
Get-Process -Name "ChocolateySoftware.ChocolateyManagement.Web.Mvc" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force -PassThru
~~~

And then try accessing the website again.  Any emails that are then sent from CCM should then contain valid links back to the site.

## Chocolatey Configuration for CCM

The following configuration values, with their default values, are added into the chocolatey.config file after installing CCM and it's dependent packages.

### centralManagementReportPackagesTimerIntervalInSeconds

This is the length of time, in seconds, that the Chocolatey Background Agent will wait between each attempt to report into CCM.

**Default Value:** 1800

### centralManagementServiceUrl

This is the URL that is used by the Chocolatey Background Agent to report into CCM, and also by the CCM Service to register the URL that it is listening for incoming reports on.

**Default Value:** _blank_

**NOTE:** If left blank, the CCM Service will construct a URL based on the default Port number which is 24020, and the FQDN of the machine that the service is being executed on.  However, Chocolatey Agent will not be able to report into CCM, if a value is not provided.

**NOTE:** If the Chocolatey Background Agent is installed on the same machine that has the CCM Service installed, it can only report into that CCM Service.

### centralManagementReceiveTimeoutInSeconds

This is the length of time, in seconds, that a connection to CCM can remain inactive, during which no application messages are received, before it is dropped.

**Default Value:** 30

### centralManagementSendTimeoutInSeconds

This is the length of time, in seconds, that a write operation against CCM has to complete before the transport raises an exception.

**Default Value:** 30

### centralManagementCertificateValidationMode

This captures the options for determining the validity of the CCM Service certificate obtained using SSL/TLS negotiation.

**Default Value:** PeerOrChainTrust

**Valid Values:** None, PeerTrust, ChainTrust, PeerOrChainTrust, Custom

## Chocolatey Clients

Once CCM has been set up and configured, each machine that you want to report into CCM will have to be enabled.  This can be done by doing the following:

~~~powershell
choco config set CentralManagementServiceUrl https://MACHINE1:24020/ChocolateyManagementService
choco feature enable --name="'useChocolateyCentralManagement'"
~~~

Here, the full URL, including the port number, to where the CCM service was installed to is being set, and then the `useChocolateyCentralManagement` feature is being enabled. In your environment you would replace `MACHINE1:24020` with the FQDN name of your server and the port being used.

**NOTE:** By default, this feature is disabled, and will need to be turned on.

**NOTE:** If not set, the CCM Service will construct a URL based on the default Port number which is 24020, and the FQDN of the machine that the service is being executed on.  However, Chocolatey Agent will not be able to report into CCM, if a value is not provided.

[Additional configuration](#chocolatey-configuration-for-chocolatey-central-management) exists for CCM Service, which allows fine grained control of how Chocolatey Agent will report into CCM.

## Complete Installation Script

The following is a complete installation script that can be used as an **example** (which should be modified to fit with your environment before executing) of how to install all necessary CCM components and configuration on a **single machine**, using all the **default values**.

To use values other than the default, see the relevant parameters section for the [chocolatey-management-database](#package-parameters), [chocolatey-management-service](#package-parameters-1) and [chocolatey-management-web](#package-parameters-2) packages.  And refer to the [Chocolatey Configuration](#chocolatey-configuration-for-ccm) for further information about global settings for CCM.

~~~powershell
# Find FDQN for current machine
$hostName = [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostName()
$domainName = [System.Net.NetworkInformation.IPGlobalProperties]::GetIPGlobalProperties().DomainName

if(-Not $hostName.endswith($domainName)) {
  $hostName += "." + $domainName
}

> Best practices in scripts are noted here:
> * Use `upgrade` instead of `install` - upgrade is more making the script reusable when newer versions are available.
> * Always use `-y` to ensure nothing stops and prompts for more than 30 seconds.
> * When using options prefer a longer name (`--name` versus the short `-n`) to make the scripts more self-documenting
> * When using options that have a value passed, add an `=` between and surround the value with `"''"` (`--name="'value'"`). This ensures that the argument is not split between different versions/editions of Chocolatey. This also ensures that values like `.` and `\\` are not escaped by PowerShell.


## FAQ

### Will this become available for lower editions of Chocolatey?

CCM will only be available in Chocolatey for Business (C4B).

### What's the minimum version of the Chocolatey packages I need to use CCM?

See [Requirements](#requirements).

### How can I add SQL Server Permissions through PowerShell

The following script is an example of how to add `db_owner` permissions to a SQL Server Database

**NOTE:** You will need to change `MACHINE1\SQLSERVERCCM` and `ChocolateyManagement` to the actual name of the SQL Server Instance and Database being used, and this script will have to be run by someone who has the correct permissions to the SQL Server Instance.  In addition, change the `$username` variable for each user that requires permission to the database.

~~~powershell
$username = 'CCMSERVER\ChocolateyLocalAdmin'
$database = 'ChocolateyManagement'
$chocolateyLocalAdminQuery = "
USE [master]
CREATE LOGIN [$username] FROM WINDOWS WITH DEFAULT_DATABASE=[master]
USE [$database]
CREATE USER [$username] FOR LOGIN [$username]
USE [$database]
ALTER ROLE [db_owner] ADD MEMBER [$username]
"

$Connection = New-Object System.Data.SQLClient.SQLConnection
$Connection.ConnectionString = "server='MACHINE1\SQLSERVERCCM';database='master';trusted_connection=true;"
$Connection.Open()
$Command = New-Object System.Data.SQLClient.SQLCommand
$Command.CommandText = $chocolateyLocalAdminQuery
$Command.Connection = $Connection
$Command.ExecuteNonQuery()
$Connection.Close()
~~~

### How can I view what SSL registrations have been made by the installation of chocolatey-management-service

By default, the installation of the `chocolatey-management-service` package will register a single netsh binding between a self-signed certificate (created at the point of installation) and port 24020.  This can be verified using the following command:

~~~powershell
netsh http show sslcert
~~~

### How can I remove a netsh binding that has been created

If you need to remove a netsh binding, you can do that using the following command:

~~~powershell
netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:<port_number>
~~~

**NOTE:** Here `<port_number>` should be replaced with the Port Number that has been registered

### Can I manually create an SSL binding?

If required, it is possible to manually create a netsh binding.  This is done using the following command:

~~~powershell
netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:<port_number> certhash=<certificate_thumbprint> appid={<random_guid>}
~~~

**NOTE:** Here, `<port_number>` should be replaced with the Port Number to be used for the registration.  `<certifcate_thumbprint>` should be replaced with the thumbprint for the certificate that is to be used for the registration.  `<random_guid>` should be replaced with a random guid in the following format `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

### Where can I find all the log files for Chocolatey Central Management

Due to the fact that Chocolatey Central Management is made up of a number of components, there are a few places that log files exist, and you may be asked for these when engaging with support.

#### Website

Log file is located at `C:\tools\chocolatey-management-web\App_Data\Logs\Logs.txt`

#### Chocolatey Management Service

Log file is located at `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\chocolatey-management-service\tools\service\logs\chocolatey.service.host.log`

#### Chocolatey Agent Service

Log file is located at `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\chocolatey-agent\tools\service\logs\chocolatey-agent.log`

### How can I increase the level of logging for Chocolatey Central Management

This can be done by changing the level value, which should be currently INFO, to use DEBUG, as per the following:

~~~
<root>
  <level value="DEBUG" />
  <appender-ref ref="ColoredConsoleAppender" />
  <appender-ref ref="RollingLogFileAppender" />
</root>
~~~

In the following files:

* C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\chocolatey.management.service\tools\service\chocolatey.console.service.host.exe.config
* C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\chocolatey-agent\tools\service\chocolatey-agent.exe.config

### Can I install the Chocolatey Central Management Web Site under a Virtual Directory in IIS?

Currently no.  The Chocolatey Central Management Web Site expects to reside at the site level within IIS.

### We want to set up the Chocolatey Central Management service to use a domain account that will have local admin on each box. Can we do this?

Yes, absolutely. You will pass those credentials through at install/upgrade time, and you will also want to turn on the feature useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades (see [configuration](https://chocolatey.org/docs/chocolatey-configuration#features)) so that future upgrades will have that information available. The remembered arguments are stored encrypted on the box (that encryption is reversible so you may opt to pass that information each time).

* `/Username`: - provide username - instead of using the default 'ChocolateyLocalAdmin' user.
* `/Password`: - optional password for the user.
* `/EnterPassword` - receive the password at runtime as a secure string

You would pass something like `choco install chocolatey-management-service -y --params="'/Username:domain\account /EnterPassword'"` to securely pass the password at runtime. You could also run `choco install chocolatey-management-service -y --params="'/Username:<domain\account>'" --package-parameters-sensitive="'/Password:<password>'"` (or do it as part of `choco upgrade`).

### Is the password stored anywhere?

No, that would reduce the security of the password. It exists in memory long enough to set the value on user and the service and then it is cleared.

There is no storage of the password anywhere other than how Windows stores passwords.

### We are going to use our own account with a rotating password. When we rotate the password for the account that we use for the Chocolatey Management Service, what do we need to do?

Like with any service that uses rotating passwords, you will need to redeploy the service or go into the services management console and update the password. As it is much faster to deploy out that update, you can do something like `choco upgrade chocolatey-management-service -y --params="'/Username:domain\account'" --package-parameters-sensitive="'/Password:newpassword'" --force` (the `--force` ensures the code is redeployed).

### Tell me more about the Chocolatey managed password.

So you've seen from above that

* It is 32 characters long.
* It uses uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols to meet very stringent complexity requirements.
* The password is different for every machine.
* Due to the way that it is generated, it is completely unguessable.
* No one at Chocolatey Software could even tell you what the password is for a particular machine without local access.

Chocolatey uses something unique about each system, along with an encrypted value in the licensed code base to generate base password, then it makes some other changes to ensure that the password meets complexity requirements. We won't give you the full algorithm of how the password is generated as knowing the algorithm would be a security issue - like having a partial picture of a key, you could start working on how to break in. Unlike a picture of a key, even knowing the full algorithm doesn't get you everything you need as you would need local access to each box to determine the password for **each** machine.

### Is the managed password stored or logged anywhere?

No, that would reduce the security of the password. It exists in memory long enough to set the value on user and the service and then it is cleared.

There is no storage of the password anywhere other than how Windows stores passwords.

### Is the managed password the same on every machine?

No, it is different for every machine it is deployed to.

### How would someone potentially get access to the managed password?

The Chocolatey licensed code base is encrypted, so only people that work at Chocolatey Software would be able to determine the password for a particular box (just that one) **IF** they have local access to that box. Even with all of the information and the algorithm, it's still going to take our folks a while to determine the password. That gets them access to one machine. Of course, Chocolatey folks are not going to do this for obvious reasons.

So let's realize this to its full potential - If someone were able to hack the Chocolatey licensed codebase, they would be able to determine the full password algorithm. Then they'd also need to hack into your infrastructure and get local access to every box that they wanted to get the Chocolatey-managed password so they could get admin access to just that box. Taking this out a bit further, it's reasonable to assume that if someone has hacked into your infrastructure, it's highly unlikely they are going to be using a non-administrator account to get local access to a box so they can get the password for an administrator account for just that one box. It's more likely they would would already have a local admin account for the boxes they are attacking, and are likely to seek other attack vectors that are much less sophisticated.

### Do you rotate the managed password on a schedule?

We are looking to do this in a future release. We may make the schedule configurable.

### Can I take advantage of Chocolatey managed passwords with my own Windows services?

Yes, absolutely. If you use C4B's PowerShell Windows Services code, you will be able to install services and have Chocolatey manage the password for those as well.

## Common Errors and Resolutions

### The specified path, file name, or both are too long

This error can occur when installing the `chocolatey-management-web` package.  Due to the nested folder structure contained within this package, when extracting to the default cache location, the path can become too long.  This problem is known is occur in the 0.1.0-beta-20181009 release of this package, and it should be corrected in subsequent releases.  As a workaround, adding the following parameters to the install command should allow the installation to complete successfully:

~~~powershell
--cache-location="'C:\Temp\choco'"
~~~

### Chocolatey Agent Service is unable to communicate with Chocolatey Central Management Service

There is a known issue with the beta release of Chocolatey Central Management where an inconsistent Port Number is used between these two services.  One used 24020 and the other used 24040.  The correct default Port Number is 24020, and this is used in the 0.1.0 release of Chocolatey Central Management.  If required, the Port Number can be explicitly set during the installation of the Chocolatey Central Management packages using the following option when installing `chocolatey-management-service`:

~~~powershell
--params="'/PortNumber=24020'"
~~~

### HTTP Error when trying to access Chocolatey Central Management Website

When you try to access the Chocolatey Central Management Website (by default, this is hosted on http://localhost), errors messages similar to the following may be returned:

`HTTP Error 500.19 - Internal Server Error`

These errors happen very early in the application execution, and as a result, are not logged to the standard log location.  It is possible to increase the logging that is performed by the ASP.NET Worker Process, so that additional information about the error can be found.  Follow these steps to enable that additional logging:

1. In Windows Explorer, navigate to the `c:/tools/chocolatey-management-web` folder
1. Find the `web.config` file and open this in a text editor
1. Locate the `stdoutLogEnabled` attribute, which will be set to false by default
1. Change this to true, and save the file
1. Check to see if there is a running process called `ChocolateySoftware.ChocolateyManagement.Web.Mvc.exe`.  If there is, stop it.
1. Attempt to access the website again.  An additional log file will be created in the `App_Data\Logs\stdout` folder
1. Review this log for additional error information
1. Ensure that you set the `stdoutLogEnabled` attribute back to false

In these situations, we have found that incorrect database connection strings are typically the root cause of the problem.

### A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name KeyUsage

This is known issue with the beta release of Chocolatey Central Management regarding the creation of a Self Signed Certificate.  You may see the error:

`A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name KeyUsage`

This happens when installing Chocolatey Central Management on a machine that has PowerShell 4 or earlier.  This is corrected in the 0.1.0 release of Chocolatey Central Management.

To work around this issue, you can use the following script to manually create a Self Signed Certificate, which will then be used to continue the installation:

~~~powershell
$hostName = [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostName()
$domainName = [System.Net.NetworkInformation.IPGlobalProperties]::GetIPGlobalProperties().DomainName

if(-Not $hostName.endswith($domainName)) {
  $hostName += "." + $domainName
}

$certificateDnsName = $hostName

$newCert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertStoreLocation cert:\LocalMachine\My -DnsName $certificateDnsName

# move the certificate to 'TrustedPeople'
$certPath = Get-ChildItem -Path 'Cert:\\LocalMachine\\My' | Where-Object subject -like "*$certificateDnsName"
$null = Move-Item -Path $certPath.PsPath -Destination 'Cert:\\LocalMachine\\TrustedPeople'
~~~

### Chocolatey Central Management database package installs without error, but ChocolateyManagement database is not created

In the beta version of the Chocolatey Central Management database package, if there was an error during the creation of the database, no exit code was used.  As a result, the package could state that it was installed correctly, but the database would not have been created.  This has been corrected in the 0.1.0 release of Chocolatey Central Management.

When this occurs, the problem is typically the connection string being used to connect to the database.  The advice is to verify that the connecting string is valid, and attempt the installation again.

### The term 'Install-ChocolateyAppSettingsJsonFile' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.

In the beta version of Chocolatey.Extension, there was a Cmdlet named Install-ChocolateyAppSettingsJsonFile and this was used in the 0.1.0-beta-20181009 release of the Chocolatey Central Management components. In the final released version of the Chocolatey.Extension, this was renamed to Install-AppSettingsJsonFile.

As a result, the Chocolatey Central Management beta no longer works with the released version of Chocolatey.Extension. This will be corrected once the next release of the Chocolatey Central Management components is completed.

### Cannot process command because of one or more missing mandatory parameters: FilePath

During the creation of Chocolatey Central Management, some additional PowerShell cmdlets were created, and these are installed as part of the Chocolatey Extension package.  These cmdlets went through a number of iterations, and as a result, different combinations of Chocolatey Central Management packages were incompatible with the Chocolatey Extension package, resulting in the error:

`Cannot process command because of one or more missing mandatory parameters: FilePath`

The guidance in this case is either to pin to the specific version of the Chocolatey Extension package required by the version of Chocolatey Central Management being used, or, update to the latest versions of all packages, where the situation should be addressed.

### All attempts to send email from CCM result in an error

When any attempt is made by CCM to send an email, an error occurs.  This either results in an HTTP 500 errors similar to the following:

![HTTP 500 error when sending email](images/features/ccm/error_when_sending_email_500.png)

Or an inline error, similar to this:

![Inline error when sending email](images/features/ccm/error_when_sending_email_inline.png)

Checking the log file, an error similar to this is found:

~~~powershell
ERROR 2019-06-14 00:54:03,491 [55   ] Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel      - Connection id "0HLNGIPBBV01R", Request id "0HLNGIPBBV01R:00000001": An unhandled exception was thrown by the application.
System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (0x80004005): No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it 127.0.0.1:25
~~~

This is caused due to the default SMTP configuration being used by CCM, which is incompatible with the environment.  CCM, by default, assumes that there is an available SMTP Server available on the current machine, using port 25.  To fix this, follow the installation steps [above](#smtp-configuration).

### Emails sent from CCM to users has links that contains localhost, rather than actual CCM Server name

There is a requirement within the CCM site to send emails to end users of the application.  For example, when registering a new user, or resetting a password.  When this happens, the email should contain a link back to the CCM Site, which the user can click on to bring up the site in their browser.  However, emails sent from CCM contain links that contain localhost in the address, which means when clicked on, they fail to open correctly.  This can be fixed by making a change to the `appsettings.json` file which is located in the `c:\tools\chocolatey-management-web` folder.

Open this file in a text editor, and add the following entry:

~~~json
    "App": {
        "WebSiteRootAddress": "<URL_to_CCM>"
    }
~~~

NOTE: When adding this entry, be sure to include a `,` either before or after the entry, depending on where you add it in the file.  i.e. the end result needs to be a properly formatted JSON document.

where `URL_to_CCM` should be the accessible URL to access the CCM Website.  This will typically be the FQDN of the server that is hosting the CCM Web Site, but it will depend on your environments configuration.

The end result should look something like this:

![Modified appsettings.json file](images/features/ccm/updated_appsettingsjson_file.png)

Once this change has been added, save the file, and then run the following to ensure that the process running the CCM Website is stopped:

~~~powershell
Get-Process -Name "ChocolateySoftware.ChocolateyManagement.Web.Mvc" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force -PassThru
~~~

And then try accessing the website again.  Any emails that are then sent from CCM should then contain valid links back to the site.

### The remote server returned an unexpected response: (413) Request Entity Too Large

When reporting a larger number of packages (approximately 200), this error may be reported.  This is due to the size of the information, in bytes, being too large to send between the Chocolatey Agent Service and the Chocolatey Central Management Service.  This has been identified as a [bug](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/95), which is due to be corrected in version 0.1.1 of Chocolatey Central Management

### ERROR: Cannot index into a null array

This error can be reported when installing the Chocolatey Central Management Service.  This can happen depending on the netsh binding that are currently present on the machine that is being installed on.  If for example, you have enabled SNI on a website on the machine that you are installing onto, then this error may occur.  This has been identified as a [bug](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/96), which is due to be corrected in version 0.1.1 of Chocolatey Central Management.
