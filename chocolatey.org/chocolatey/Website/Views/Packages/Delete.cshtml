            <p>
                Our policy is to only permanently delete Chocolatey packages that really need it, such as
                packages that contain passwords, malicious/harmful code, etc. This policy is very similar
                to the policies employed by other package managers such as
                <a href="http://help.rubygems.org/kb/gemcutter/removing-a-published-rubygem" title="">Ruby Gems</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlisting the package will remove the package from
                being available in the Chocolatey Gallery. The package is still available for download as a dependency for
                two main reasons.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Other packages may depend on that package. Those packages might not necessarily be in this gallery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Helps ensure that important community owned packages are not mass deleted.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-0">
                If you need the package permanently removed, click on the <a href="@Url.Action(MVC.Packages.ReportAbuse(Model.Id, Model.Version))" title="Report Abuse">Report Abuse</a> link and we'll take care
                of it for you. PLEASE ONLY DO THIS IF THERE IS AN URGENT PROBLEM WITH THE PACKAGE.
                (Passwords, malicious code, etc). Even if you remove it, it&#8217;s prudent to immediately
                reset any passwords/sensitive data you accidentally pushed instead of waiting for us to delete
                the package.
