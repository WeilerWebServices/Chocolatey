                <p>Welcome to the Chocolatey Community Package Repository! The packages found in this section of the site are provided, maintained, and moderated by the community.</p>
                <h3>Moderation</h3>
                <p>Every version of each package undergoes a rigorous moderation process before it goes live that typically includes:</p>
                <ul>

                <h3>Organizational Use</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are an organization using Chocolatey, we want your experience to be fully reliable.
                    Due to the nature of this publicly offered repository, <a href="@Url.RouteUrl(RouteName.Docs, new { docName = "community-packages-disclaimer" })#reliability" target="_blank">reliability</a> cannot be guaranteed.
                    Packages offered here are subject to distribution rights, which means they may need to reach out further to the internet to the official locations to download files at runtime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, distribution rights do not apply for internal use. With any edition of Chocolatey (including the free open source edition), you can <a href="@Url.RouteUrl(RouteName.Docs, new { docName = "how-to-host-feed" })" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">host your own packages</a> and cache or <a href="@Url.RouteUrl(RouteName.Docs, new { docName = "how-to-recompile-packages" })" target="_blank">internalize</a> existing community packages.
                </p>
                <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>Your use of the packages on this site means you understand they are not supported or guaranteed in any way. <a href="@Url.RouteUrl(RouteName.Docs, new { docName = "community-packages-disclaimer" })" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Learn more...</a></p>
