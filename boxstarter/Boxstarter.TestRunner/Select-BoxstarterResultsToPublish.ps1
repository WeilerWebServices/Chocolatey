function Select-BoxstarterResultsToPublish {
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Returns successful Boxstarter packages from provided test results
eligible to be published to a NuGet feed.

.DESCRIPTION
Test-BoxstarterPackage will return a set of test results given an
array of packages or an entire repository. Select-BoxstarterResultsToPublish
can consume these results and return the package IDs of the packages who
had all test machines pass the package install. One could then have
Publish-BoxstarterPackage consume this output and publish those packages
to their respectful feeds.

.PARAMETER Results
An array of PSObjects returned from Test-BostarterPackages. These
objects contain metadata about a packages' test run on a single test
machine. The data will report if the test completed and if there were
any exceptions.

.EXAMPLE
Test-BoxstarterPackages | Select-BoxstarterResultsToPublish | Publish-BoxstarterPackage

This will test all packages in the Boxstarter LocalRepo that have a
repository version greater than its published version. The results of
the tests will be passed to Select-BoxstarterResultsToPublish to
choose the packages which passed on all test machines.
Set-BoxstarterDeployOptions can be used to designate the machines to
be used for testing. The successful packages are then piped to
Publish-BoxstarterPackage which publishes the packages to their
associated NuGet feed.
