### Exit Codes
* [x] `usePackageExitCodes` - Use Package Exit Codes - Package scripts can provide exit codes. With this on, package exit codes will be what choco uses for exit when non-zero (this value can come from a dependency package). Chocolatey defines valid exit codes as 0, 1605, 1614, 1641, 3010. With this feature off, choco will exit with 0, 1, or -1 (matching previous behavior). Available in 0.9.10+.
* [ ] `useEnhancedExitCodes` - Use Enhanced Exit Codes - Chocolatey is able to provide enhanced exit codes surrounding list, search, info, outdated and other commands that don't deal directly with package operations. To see enhanced exit codes and their meanings, please run `choco [cmdname] -?`. With this feature off, choco will exit with 0, 1, or -1  (matching previous behavior). Available in 0.10.12+. Default off in 0.10.14+.
* [ ] `exitOnRebootDetected` - Exit On Reboot Detected - Stop running install, upgrade, or uninstall when a reboot request is detected. Requires 'usePackageExitCodes' feature to be turned on.

* [ ] `failOnAutoUninstaller` - Fail if automatic uninstaller fails.
* [ ] `stopOnFirstPackageFailure` - Stop On First Package Failure - stop running install, upgrade or uninstall on first package failure instead of continuing with others. As this will affect upgrade all, it is normally recommended to leave this off. Available in 0.10.4+.

* [ ] `scriptsCheckLastExitCode` - Scripts Check $LastExitCode (external commands) - Leave this off unless you absolutely need it while you fix your package scripts  to use `throw 'error message'` or `Set-PowerShellExitCode #` instead of `exit #`. This behavior started in 0.9.10 and produced hard to find bugs. If the last external process exits successfully but with an exit code of not zero, this could cause hard to detect package failures. Available in 0.10.3+. Will be removed in 0.11.0.
