## QDE Components

The QDE appliance provides a unified architecture containing the following components:

* **Sonatype Nexus Repository OSS** (pre-configured with repositories) - This is your repository, where you'll be storing your Chocolatey packages (nupkg files).
* **Jenkins** (pre-configured with internalizer jobs) - This is your automation engine, that lets you run tasks on-demand and on a schedule. It will host the PowerShell scripts to help you auto-internalize packages from the Chocolatey Community Repository
* **Chocolatey Central Management** - This is your web dashboard for Chocolatey, that will allow you to track and monitor Chocolatey packages on your endpoint clients. You can see what packages are installed where, and whether or not they are out-of-date.
* **Scripts for Internal Deployment** - Various scripts to help you configure this solution are included, for your convenience.

> :warning: **WARNING**
>
> This solution targets environments up to about **1000 nodes**.
> If you need a solution for a larger environment, QDE would still be suitable as a proof-of-concept, however, best practices would recommend a distributed infrastructure, separating each component into its own discrete node.
> If you find yourself in need of a more scalable solution, please contact Support and we'll be more than happy to provide guidance for larger solutions.

## Getting QDE

To get QDE into your environment, please [reach out to us](https://chocolatey.org/contact/quick-deployment) and we can work to get you set up.

> :memo: **NOTE**: A QDE environment is a fully functional Chocolatey for Business (C4B) environment, as such it will require a business or trial license.

## FAQs

### What does the QDE (Quick Deployment Environment) include?

* Repository Server - Nexus (pre-configured with repositories)
* Automation Pipelines - Jenkins (pre-configured with internalizer jobs)
* Chocolatey Central Management
* Package Builder / Package Internalizer
* All the goodness of that sweet, sweet automation in Chocolatey.
* Scripts for Internal Deployment

### How much time does this save?

Typically, setting up a proper Chocolatey Central Management server and any accompanying infrastructure takes somewhere between 1-5 days, even when you have everything you need to get started. Setting up a new piece of infrastructure can be pretty cumbersome, we know. The QDE contains pretty much everything you need to get started in a single image, all ready to go. At most, it should only take a couple of hours to get everything ready to go from there.

### How do I take advantage of QDE?
You must have a [Business edition of Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/compare) or be on an active trial license. Fill out the [quick deployment request form](https://chocolatey.org/contact/quick-deployment) and we will reach out with all the necessary information to get you started.

### I'm already a C4B customer?
Fill out the [quick deployment request form](https://chocolatey.org/contact/quick-deployment) and we will reach out with all the necessary information to get you started. Be sure to mention you are already a C4B customer.

### What if I have a larger environment? (> 1k nodes)

While this solution will be great to get a glimpse of what Chocolatey can really do for you, by its nature it isn't the silver bullet for every environment.

If you have a larger environment, we would strongly recommend taking the time to set up the various services on separate hosts to make them easier to manage and ensure they have the necessary resources to handle heavier loads.

### Can we brag about how fast we were able to get configured?

Please do! :slightly_smiling_face:
